<!--Recipe description-->
<h2>Why you should make this recipe</h2>
<p>1. Moist and tender salmon</p>
<p>No one likes dry salmon. Cooking the salmon in foil is all about retaining the moisture and tenderness inside. This method, when cooked over low heat, also ensures a proper steaming process. It locks in all the delicious juice, resulting in a lush and delicate salmon!</p>
<p>2. Cooks up fast and cleans easy</p>
<p>You can literary cook the salmon in 12 minutes. Also, since everything is tucked inside the foil, it makes the easiest cleanup. You don’t even have to clean the stove or the frying pan.</p>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Preparing the salmon</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Sprinkle Diamond Crystal kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper on both sides of 2 skin-on salmon fillets.</li>
  <li>Thinly slice ½ onion and cut 3 oz carrot into julienne strips.</li>
  <li>Cut off the bottom of 1.8 oz shimeji mushrooms and 2 shiitake mushrooms. Break up shimeji mushrooms with your hands and thinly slice shiitake mushrooms.</li>
  <li>Cut 1 green onion into small pieces.</li>
  <li>Prepare 2 12- x 12-inch sheets of aluminum foil. Thinly spread ½ Tbsp of the 2 Tbsp unsalted butter in the centers of the foil sheets (reserve the other 1½ Tbsp for later).</li>
  <li>Place half of the onion slices and put the salmon on top, skin side down.</li>
  <li>Put two kinds of mushrooms and then carrot julienne strips on top of the salmon.</li>
  <li>Add the miso and rest of the butter on top.</li>
  <li>Bring the top and bottom aluminum foil over the salmon and fold a few times. Then bring the sides together and fold a few times to make sure the foil is tightly closed and no opening. Repeat the same process for the other fillet.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cooking the salmon</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Place the two sets of salmon in foil on a frying pan and cover with a lid (no need to add water). Cook the salmon over medium heat for 2 minutes, then medium-low heat for 10 minutes. If you have 1- to 1½-inch-thick salmon, you will need to cook for 15–18 minutes (open the foil to check the doneness).
